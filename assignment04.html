    <h3>que 1. "List out the features of HTML5" and the answer is given below</h3>
    <p>
        HTML5, the latest version of the HyperText Markup Language, introduced several new features and enhancements over its predecessors. Here is a list of some key features of HTML5:
        
        <ol>
            
            <li>
                <b>New Doctype: HTML5 uses a simpler and shorter doctype declaration (<!DOCTYPE html>) compared to previous versions.</b></li>
                
                <li><b>Semantic Elements: HTML5 introduces new semantic elements like header, footer, nav, article, section, and aside, which provide a more meaningful structure to web documents.</b></li>

    <h3>que 2. "What are HTML entities? List out 5 commomly used HTNL Entities" and the answer is given below</h3>
    <p>
        HTML entities are special codes that represent characters that have a special meaning in HTML or characters that cannot easily be typed or displayed. They are often used to display reserved characters, such as angle brackets (< and >), ampersands (&), quotes, and special symbols, without disrupting the HTML structure. Here are five commonly used HTML entities:
        
        <ol>
            <li>
                <b>&lt</b> - Represents the less-than symbol (<). It is used to display the less-than sign without starting an HTML tag.</li>
            
             <li>
                <b>&gt</b> - Represents the greater-than symbol (>). It is used to display the greater-than sign without ending an HTML tag.</li>
            
             <li>
                <b>&amp</b> - Represents the ampersand (&). It is used to display the ampersand symbol without starting an entity reference.</li>
            
             <li>
                <b>&quot</b> - Represents the double quotation mark ("). It is used to display a double quote without ending the attribute value in an HTML tag.</li>
            
             <li>
                <b>&apos</b> - Represents the single quotation mark ('). This entity is often used in XML documents and older versions of HTML to display a single quote. However, in modern HTML, single quotes can generally be used without needing an entity reference.</li> </ol>
        
        Using these entities ensures that special characters are displayed correctly in web pages without interfering with the HTML structure or causing parsing errors.

    <h3>que 3. "Define accessibility in the context of wev development. Discuss why it's essential to create accessible websites and how it benefits different useer groups" and the answer is given below</h3>
    <p>
        Accessibility in Web Development: <br><br>
        <b>Defination: </b> <br>
        Accessibility in web development refers to the practice of designing and developing websites and applications that can be used and accessed by people of all abilities and disabilities. It ensures that people with disabilities, including those with visual, auditory, motor, and cognitive impairments, can perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with websites effectively. Accessible websites are designed to provide equal opportunities and an inclusive user experience for everyone, regardless of their abilities or disabilities.
        <br><br>
         <b>Importance of Creating Accessible Websites:</b> <br>
         <ol>
            <li>
                <b>Inclusivity:</b> Accessible websites make the internet inclusive for everyone, ensuring that people with disabilities can participate fully in online activities, such as education, employment, and social interactions.</li>
            <li>
                <b>Legal compliance: </b> Many countries have laws and regulations, such as the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) in the United States and the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) globally, that mandate accessible web design. Non-compliance can lead to legal consequences.</li>
            <li>
                <b>Ethical responsibility:</b>  Creating accessible websites is an ethical responsibility, promoting social equity and ensuring that no one is excluded from accessing essential information and services.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Better user Experience:</b>Accessibility features, such as clear navigation, readable text, and keyboard-friendly interactions, improve the user experience for all users, not just those with disabilities.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Search Engine Optimisation</b>Accessible websites tend to have well-organized structures and clear content, which can improve search engine rankings and make the website more discoverable for all users.
            </li>
         </ol>

         <b>Benefits for Different User Groups:</b>
         <ol>
            <li>
                <b>Visually Impaired Users:</b>Accessible websites utilize screen reader-friendly content and provide alternative text for images, enabling visually impaired users to understand and navigate the content using screen readers.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Hearing Impaired Users:</b>Subtitles, captions, and transcripts for multimedia content ensure that users with hearing impairments can access information presented in audio or video formats.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Notor Impaired Users:</b>Keyboard shortcuts, large clickable areas, and easily navigable interfaces benefit users with motor impairments who might have difficulty using a mouse or touchpad.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Cognitive Impaired Users:</b>Clear and simple language, consistent navigation, and easy-to-understand instructions benefit users with cognitive impairments, making the content more accessible and comprehensible.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Elderly Users:</b> As people age, they may experience various impairments. Accessible websites accommodate these changes, making it easier for elderly users to access information online.:
            </li>

         </ol>
         In summary, creating accessible websites is essential for ensuring equal access, fostering inclusivity, and providing a positive user experience for people with diverse abilities and disabilities. It is a fundamental aspect of responsible web development that benefits not only specific user groups but society as a whole.

    <h3>que 4."List any 3 ways which help us in improving the accessibility of HTML" and the answers is given below</h3>
    <p>Certainly, here are three ways to improve the accessibility of HTML, along with their explanations:
        <ol>
            <li>
                <b>Semantic HTNL elements</b> Semantic HTML elements like "header", "nav", "main", "article", "section", and "footer" provide meaning and structure to the content. Using these elements appropriately helps screen readers and other assistive technologies understand the document structure, enhancing accessibility. For example, using "nav" for navigation menus and "footer" for footer content clarifies the purpose of different sections, making the website more accessible.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Descriptive Text and Alternative Text for Images:</b> Providing descriptive text through appropriate labels and alternative text for images ensures that users with visual impairments or those using text-only browsers can understand the content. Use the alt attribute in "img" elements to describe the image content. For decorative images, use empty (alt="") or null (alt attribute omitted) alternative text to indicate that the image is purely decorative and does not convey meaningful content.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Keyboard Accessibility:</b>Ensure all interactive elements are accessible via keyboard navigation. Users with motor disabilities often rely on keyboards or other assistive devices. Use focus styles to indicate keyboard focus on interactive elements. CSS can be used to style focus states, ensuring users can see which element is currently focused. Additionally, interactive elements like buttons and links should be focusable ("button", "a") and form elements should have associated :label" elements to provide context and improve keyboard accessibility.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Use Color with Care:</b> Color plays an important role in web design , but it should not be the only means of conveying information. Ensure that color is not the sole indicator of meaning . For example , when using error messages, pair color with text that explains the error. Additionally,maintain sufficient color contrast between text and background to enhance readablity for users with low vision.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </p>
